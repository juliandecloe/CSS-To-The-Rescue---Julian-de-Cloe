# My Anticlimax Fireworkshow

Welcome to the beginning of the proces of making my anticlimax firework show. I'll take you to the steps I took and where I went wrong.

## Week 1: Firework Arrow

I started this journey with a different plan. Have you seen Kung Fu Panda? In the first movie he tries to get over a wall using fireworks and a chair. I wanted to recreate this.

It started with the basics. Using images for the panda.

```
<label for="">
    <img src="img/panda.png" alt="Kung Fu Panda">
    <img src="img/chair.png" alt="Chair">
</label>
```
```
img:first-child {
	position: absolute;
	top: 5vh;
	left: 7vw;
	z-index: 1;
}

img:last-child {
	position: absolute;
	top: 8vh;
	left: 3vw;
	width: 280px;
	transform: scaleX(-1);
}
```


Next I had my first challange: Making a first interactive firework arrow. I tried it using a lot of figures for different elements. I wanted to give it a nice look with a lighthouse kind of pattern on it. For every stripe on the arrow I used a different `<figure>` element.

This worked, but I knew it could be way easier. My teacher taught me how to use gradients. Now I use a `radial-gradient` for the middlepart of the arrow,

The only way I could make it interactive was using a `<label>` element. With the `<label>` I made a firework arrow using three `<figures>`. One for the tip, one for the body and one for the stick.

```
<label for="right-bottom">
    <figure></figure>
    <figure></figure>
    <figure></figure>
</label>
```

```
label {
	position: absolute;
	transform: scale(0.3);
	z-index: 5;
	height: 350px;
	width: 120px;
	filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 4px rgb(0,0,0,0.5));
	transition: 1s;
	cursor: pointer;
	animation: 1s
}

label > figure:first-child {
	clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 0% 100%, 100% 100%);
	border-radius: 50%;
	position: absolute;
	left: calc(50% - 55px);
	width: 110px;
	height: 130px;
	z-index: 3;
	background-image:	
		conic-gradient(
		at center top,
		transparent 146deg,
		darkgray 146deg,
		lightgray 170deg,
		darkgray 214deg,
		transparent 214deg
	);
	clip-path:ellipse(90% 70% at center top);
}

label figure:nth-child(2) {
	background: blue;
	position: absolute;
	top: 83px;
	left: calc(50% - 37.5px);
	width: 75px;
	height: 160px;
	z-index: 2;
	background-image:
		linear-gradient(
			to right,
			#303a 0%,
			transparent 65%,
			#3036 100%
		),
		repeating-radial-gradient(
			red 0 1em,
			blue 1em 2em
		);
	background-size: 100% 100%, 600% 600%;
	background-position:left top, 40% -30%;
	border-radius: 0 0 50% 50% / 0 0 1em 1em;
}

label > figure:nth-child(3) {
	position: absolute;
	background: #BA8C63;
	top: 220px;
	left: calc(50% - 37.5px);
	width: 10px;
	height: 110px;
	z-index: 1;
	box-shadow: inset -2px 0 8px rgb(0,0,0,0.5);
	clip-path: ellipse(10px 95px at 50% 10%);
}
```

This is the result:

## Week 2: Firework
Making a firework show was harder than I thought. I started using `<li>` elements wrapped in a `<ul>` element for every fire work "stroke". 

I wanted to rotate and position every li element single handedly, but it came out wrong and sloppy.

```
li:first-child {
	transform: rotateY(0deg) translateZ(100px);
	background: rgb(0,255,0,0.5);
}

li:nth-child(2) {
	transform: rotateY(30deg) translateZ(100px);
	background: rgb(0,255,0,0.5);
}

etc...
```

After a lot of messing around I came to the conclusion that this was not the way to do it. I needed to rotate the elements with a calculation so that all elements where rotated the exact degrees. This was harder than I thought because I only want them to rotate over a specific degrees. They can't go further than 60 deg in total over 7 `<li>` elements. Also I never worked with `calc()`, so it was something I had to learn. My teacher helped me with the rotate, but it was kind of complicated and therefore hard to understand. 

After rotating I started working on the `<li>` elements moving. This was a bit easier. I just needed to translate the Y position of the `<li>` elements. I wanted it to grow first, then move and then shrink again, but this gave a really weird effect.

```
transform: var(--rotate2) scaleY(5) translateY(2em) scaleY(0);
```

I was not happy with the movement, so I had to find another way. I have tried a lot of messing around with the transforms. I wasted so much time on that part that it had a really big impact on my endresult. I really should have looked at more examples so I could just move on, but I wanted to do it myself. 

Eventually my teacher helped me out. He told me to give al elements a background so you have a better look at how all the elements are positioned. This gave me a better overview of what was happening. Instead of only using transform, I started using `@keyframes` to make animations. This gave me more opportunities to customize the firework animation:

```
input:first-child[type="checkbox"]:checked ~ main section:first-child > ul > li::after {
	animation: after .3s 1s ease-out forwards;
}

@keyframes after {
	0% {
		transform: scaleY(0);
	}
	33% {
		transform: scaleY(1) ;
	}
	67% {
		transform: translateY(100%) scaleY(1) ;
	}
	100% {
		transform: translateY(200%) scaleY(0) ;
	}
}
```

After messing around with that I got something like this:

Time to add a second one!
