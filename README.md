# My Anticlimax Fireworkshow

Welcome to the beginning of the proces of making my anticlimax firework show. I'll take you to the steps I took and where I went wrong.

## Week 1

I started this journey with a different plan. Have you seen Kung Fu Panda? In the first movie he tries to get over a wall using fireworks and a chair. I wanted to recreate this.
